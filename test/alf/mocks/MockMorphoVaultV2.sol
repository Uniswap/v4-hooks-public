///            cap will silently degrade to zero deployable liquidity.
///         2. `withdraw` may be armed to revert -- emulates a curated/gated vault that
///            cannot satisfy the request from its current allocation. Use
///            `setWithdrawShortfall(true)` to arm.
///
///         Optional knobs:
///           - `setExitFeeBps(bps)` -- applies an exit-fee to `previewRedeem` (so
///             `previewRedeem < convertToAssets` is testable). `convertToAssets` is
