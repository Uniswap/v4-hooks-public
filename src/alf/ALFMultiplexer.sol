/// @title ALFMultiplexer
/// @author Uniswap Labs
///
/// @notice Stateless atomic multiplexer deployed on a virtual (zero-liquidity) pool.
///
///         The multiplexer provides onchain competitive execution across an arbitrary mix of v4
///         pools: ALF-native quoter hooks (with the rich liveness / gas-budget / attestation
///         surface), vanilla CFMM pools, and third-party hooks that override the AMM curve. It
///         receives a set of targeted candidate pools from the router via hookData, sizes each
///         via a tiered quote waterfall, and executes a **greedy split fill** that distributes
///         swap flow across candidates in order of indicative quality.
///
///         ## Tiered Quote Waterfall
///
///         Per candidate, the multiplexer probes for indicative pricing in order of richness.
///         Tier selection is purely a property of the candidate's PoolKey (hook flags +
///         ERC-165 advertisement); the router doesn't need to know which tier will fire.
///
///           1. **IALFHook** (ERC-165 detected) — the rich path: liveness check, gas budget,
///              attestation, and per-candidate ALFHookData.
///           2. **SwapSimulator** — for vanilla CFMM pools and hooks that don't override the
///              swap curve (no `beforeSwap` / `afterSwap` returns-delta flags, no dynamic-fee
///              hook with `BEFORE_SWAP_FLAG`). Walks the pool's real state via extsload;
///              exact in-frame.
///           3. **IIndicativeQuote** (ERC-165 detected) — minimal view-style quote surface for
///              hooks that override the curve (PropAMM hooks, aggregator hooks). Invoked via
///              low-level `staticcall` so non-`view` implementations can satisfy the interface,
///              but state writes revert.
///           4. **Reverting self-swap** — universal fallback for opaque hooks; only reached
///              from the execution path (view-side `quote()` returns no quote for these).
///
///         ## Execution Model: Greedy Split Fill
///
///         Rather than picking a single winner, the multiplexer fills candidates sequentially from
///         best to worst indicative. Each candidate receives the full remaining swap amount with
///         a `sqrtPriceLimitX96` derived from the next candidate's current pool price. This
///         causes the v4 swap loop to terminate when the current candidate's marginal price
///         worsens to the next candidate's entry level, at which point remaining flow cascades
///         to the next candidate. The result is an approximately optimal split that:
///
///           - Fills the best-priced quoter first until price impact equalizes with the next
///           - Naturally handles quoters with different fee overrides and liquidity depths
///           - Degenerates to single-quoter execution when only one target is provided
///           - Works identically for exact-input and exact-output swaps
///
///         ## Delta Forwarding
///
///         The multiplexer's virtual pool has zero liquidity — all execution happens via nested
///         `poolManager.swap()` calls on the candidates' real pools. The accumulated BalanceDelta
///         from all fills is negated into a `BeforeSwapDelta` that offsets the virtual pool's
///         swap, ensuring the multiplexer's net position is zero. The outer caller receives
///         the aggregate execution as their swap result.
///
///         ## Protocol Fees
///
///         The multiplexer does not charge a protocol fee on its own virtual pool. v4 charges
///         the protocol fee natively on each NESTED candidate swap (against the candidate's
///         own pool), so layering an additional multiplexer-level fee would double-charge
///         users. Operators who want to collect fees through this routing path SHOULD
///         configure them on the underlying candidate pools.
///
///         ## Tolerance Enforcement
///
///         Callers may set `strictTolerancePips` in MultiplexerHookData to revert if aggregate
///         execution falls below the best individual indicative by more than the specified
///         tolerance. This is a downside-only check — split fill producing more output than
///         the best individual indicative (the expected case) does not trigger a revert.
///
///         The baseline is the best PRE-execution indicative across the targets, and it is NOT
///         re-derived after execution. A tier-1 indicative can be a constant-liquidity UPPER
///         BOUND that overstates output for swaps large enough to exhaust a quoter's depth
///         (e.g. a SmartPool extrapolating its in-range buckets to the price extreme), so each
///         candidate's contribution to the baseline is first bounded by its declared effective
///         output liquidity (`getEffectiveLiquidity`); see `_baselineContribution`. Without
///         that bound a large swap against a deep-looking but shallow quoter would set an
///         unreachable threshold and trip the check on a fair fill. The bound applies only to
///         quoters that expose reserves (IALFHook); tier-2 simulator quotes are already exact
///         against real pool state, and tier-3/4 opaque quoters cannot be bounded (the
///         trusted-targets note below covers them). It is computed only when strict tolerance
///         is enabled.
///
///         A candidate that wins quoting but then contributes
///         nothing — it reverts and is soft-skipped (see Greedy Split Fill), or fills less than
///         it quoted — drops aggregate execution below that baseline and can trip the tolerance
///         revert even when the other candidates filled acceptably. This is intentional and
///         FAIL-SAFE (the check is downside-only, so the worst outcome is a revert, never a
///         bad fill), but it means a flaky or adversarial candidate in the target set can force
///         a revert ("quote-baiting") for a caller who enabled strict tolerance. Enable strict
///         tolerance only over trusted targets; otherwise bound slippage with a router-side
///         minimum-output / maximum-input check, which measures the actual aggregate execution
///         rather than a per-candidate pre-execution baseline. NOTE: hard-failing the
///         baseline-setting candidate instead of soft-skipping it would not help — its revert
///         would still abort the swap — and would break soft-fail resilience for the common
///         (non-strict) path, so the soft-skip is kept.
///
///         ## Slippage Control — the outer `sqrtPriceLimitX96` is NOT enforced
///
///         The `sqrtPriceLimitX96` a caller passes on the outer swap to the multiplexer pool has
///         NO effect on execution. The real swaps run as nested `poolManager.swap` calls inside
///         `_beforeSwap`, and those derive their own per-candidate price limits; the outer limit
///         is never propagated to them. The multiplexer then returns a `BeforeSwapDelta` that
///         offsets the outer swap, so the virtual pool itself performs no price-bounded
///         execution either. Callers MUST bound slippage via `strictTolerancePips` and/or a
///         minimum-output (or maximum-input) check in their own router — treating the outer
///         `sqrtPriceLimitX96` as an on-chain price bound (as one would for an ordinary v4 pool)
///         provides NO protection here.
///
///         ## Call Flow
///
///         ```
///         Router → poolManager.swap(multiplexerPool, hookData=[targets])
///           → ALFMultiplexer._beforeSwap()
///             → _prepareCandidates(): waterfall-quote each target, sort by indicative
///             → _executeFills(): for each candidate (best to worst):
///                 → poolManager.swap(candidate.pool, remaining, sqrtPriceLimit=next.price)
///                   → CandidateHook._beforeSwap() [if any: curve update, fee override]
///                   ← BalanceDelta
///                 ← accumulate delta, update remaining
///             ← (totalDelta, primaryCandidate, bestQuote)
///           ← BeforeSwapDelta (negated totalDelta)
///         ← BalanceDelta (aggregate result for the swapper)
///         ```
///
///         This nested-swap pattern is explicitly supported by v4's unlock model. All deltas
///         accumulate in transient storage and must net to zero before the unlock completes.
