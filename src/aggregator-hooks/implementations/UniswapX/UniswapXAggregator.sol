/// @title UniswapXAggregator
/// @notice Uniswap V4 hook whose "liquidity source" is a single UniswapX order (e.g. a Dutch order)
///         supplied as swap `hookData`. The hook acts as the UniswapX filler: it calls the Reactor's
///         `executeWithCallback`, the Reactor pulls the order swapper's input (via Permit2) to this hook
///         and invokes `reactorCallback`, during which the hook sources the order's required output from
///         the V4 PoolManager (i.e. from the V4 swapper). The V4 swapper therefore provides the counter-side
///         liquidity that fills the UniswapX order and, in return, receives the order's input token.
/// @dev    Original Dutch orders are all-or-nothing: the whole order fills or nothing does. The V4 swap amount
///         only needs to cover the order, not match it exactly: an exact-in swap may specify more input than the
///         order's resolved output requires, and an exact-out swap may request less than the order's input
///         supplies — any surplus is forwarded to the protocol's token jar (or left in this hook if no jar is
///         configured). The swap reverts only when the order's required output exceeds the specified input
///         (exact-in) or the order supplies less than the requested output (exact-out). Each swap consumes one
///         order passed fresh via `hookData`, so a
///         single deployed pool is reusable across many orders for the same token pair.
/// @dev    Stateless across pools: this hook holds no per-pool configuration (the order fully determines the
///         token pair and amounts at swap time), so one deployed hook instance can be the `hooks` address for
///         any number of V4 pools — no per-pool factory or deployment is needed. Simply mine one hook address
///         (see `AggregatorHookMiner`/`HookMiner`), deploy it once, then call `PoolManager.initialize` directly
///         for each pool that should use it.
/// @dev    Routing-style quoting (no hookData) is unsupported: `quote`/`_rawQuote`/`pseudoTotalValueLocked` revert
///         because the order is only known at swap time. Use `quoteWithHookData`, which resolves the supplied order
///         via UniswapX's OrderQuoter (note: not a view — see `_rawQuoteWithHookData`).
/// @dev    This hook opts out of protocol-fee classification: `protocolFeeFlags` returns 0, so pools using it
///         are not subject to a protocol fee.
