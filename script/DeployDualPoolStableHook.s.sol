/// @title DeployDualPoolStableHook
/// @author Uniswap Labs
/// @notice Deploys `DualPoolStableHook` through the DualPool family's `AllowlistedFactory` (see
///         `DeployDualPoolFactory.s.sol`) so aggregators and third-party routers can discover it
///         via the factory's `Deployed` event and registry, and the hook's `factory()` getter
///         reports the canonical factory. Mirror of `DeployDualPoolHook.s.sol`; only the creation
///         bytecode differs, so any previously-mined DualPoolHook salt is invalid here (different
///         init-code hash). The permission flags are identical to `DualPoolHook`'s
///         (`address & Hooks.ALL_HOOK_MASK == 0x2ac0`). The FACTORY is the CREATE2 deployer:
///         salts must be mined against the factory address.
///
///         Two salt paths:
///           - `HOOK_SALT` set: use a salt mined offchain by `script/mine_dualpool_salt.sh` with
///             `HOOK_CONTRACT=src/alf/DualPoolStableHook.sol:DualPoolStableHook` and `FACTORY`
///             set to the same address as here. It is re-derived and checked for BOTH the flag
///             bits and `MIN_LEADING_ZERO_NIBBLES` before any broadcast, so a stale or wrong-args
///             salt fails fast.
///           - `HOOK_SALT` unset AND `MIN_LEADING_ZERO_NIBBLES == 0`: mine the flags-only salt
///             in-EVM via `HookMiner.find` (fine for tests / non-vanity deploys). A non-zero vanity
///             prefix is a ~2^38 search that is infeasible in-EVM, so the script reverts and points
///             at the offchain miner.
///
///         The constructor-arg encoding here MUST match the miner's, or the salt resolves to a
///         different address. The factory additionally requires the creation code's hash to be on
///         its allowlist, so a factory pinned to a different build rejects this script up front.
///
