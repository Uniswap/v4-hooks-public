/// @title DeployDualPoolFactory
/// @author Uniswap Labs
/// @notice Deploys the DualPool hook family's canonical `AllowlistedFactory`, pinned to the CURRENT builds of
///         `DualPoolHook`, `DualPoolStableHook`, and `DualPoolIncentivizedHook`.
///         The factory is the discovery anchor for aggregators and third-party routers, so it is
///         deployed through the canonical CREATE2 proxy (`0x4e59…`) with a fixed salt: the same
///         factory bytecode and salt resolve to the same address on every chain. For a vanity
///         (leading-zero) factory address, mine `FACTORY_SALT` offchain with
///         `script/mine_factory_salt.sh`; the salt is re-derived and checked here for the
///         `MIN_LEADING_ZERO_NIBBLES` prefix before any broadcast, so a stale or wrong-build salt
///         fails fast. Unlike the hooks there are no permission-flag bits to satisfy.
///
///         The allowlist is immutable. Recompiling a hook (source, compiler version, or settings)
///         changes its creation-code hash and requires a NEW factory deployment; that is the
///         mechanism that keeps `isFromFactory` meaning "bit-exact known bytecode".
///
///         After deploying the factory, mine hook salts against ITS address
///         (`FACTORY=0x… script/mine_dualpool_salt.sh`) and deploy hooks through
///         `DeployDualPoolHook.s.sol` / `DeployDualPoolStableHook.s.sol`.
///
/// @dev Env:
///        FACTORY_SALT            (default bytes32(0)) CREATE2 salt for the factory itself, mined
///                                by `script/mine_factory_salt.sh`. Keep it fixed across chains so
///                                the factory address matches everywhere.
///        MIN_LEADING_ZERO_NIBBLES(default 0) required leading-zero hex digits of the factory
///                                address. Set to the value the salt was mined for (miner default 6).
